<br>What is a Codex? This is:
<img alt="codex" src="assets/Codex_Aureus_Sankt_Emmeram.jpg" width="250px">
<p>This is the Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram, a 9th-century illuminated Gospel Book which takes its name from Saint Emmeram's Abbey, where it was for most of its history. <br><br>
It is lavishly illuminated, (text decorated with flourishes) and it's cover is ensconced with gems and relief figures in gold. <br><br>
Precisely dated to 870, it is an important example of Carolingian art, as well as one of very few surviving treasure bindings of this date.</p>
