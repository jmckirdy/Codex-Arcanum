### <span style="color:#ff0000;background-color:black">Most High Priority</span>

- 🟩 bug: when enchanment is cast just go straight to showing the page with the new enchantment, NOT the current way. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Instead;</b> link to curr. page via url in key="enchant.inc.php?key=value& ..."

### New May+

- 🟩 feat: find 'stickers' (8-10) to include in enchantments
- 🟩 feat: get 'stickers' working in enchanments/whervever else.

- 🟩❗ bug: codexid in pfd_files table needs to be NOT NULL, when uploaded it is default null. ->MAKE SURE THAT codexid works as a FK.
  ->ok, so when looking at the pdf_files,codexid vs. codices,codexid ; they are sent at different times so synching up needs to be thought through.

1st!:increase db size requ. since u will upl big files
---------------------------->plan_breakdown:
run ALTER query, links the tables.
get an error that data will need to be truncated from ENTIRE table.
now i must pay attention to uploading new more accurate data.
keep the data from `codices` , prob rename ea. file to represent the data u are uploading in `pdf_files`.
?whilst uploading large enough files.

---

- 🟩❗ bug: test out upload sizes more, 3M + may be too much for chrome, chrome downloads the file to comp, but firefox loads it in browser. many pdfs are too big, Hamlet is the biggest working so far at 2.2M. full books are 100-200M!

  ---------------------------->plan_breakdown:
  change the mysql.ini, php.ini files ctrl+f 'max_file_size'
  troublshoot why browsers display pdfs that are large differently. what are limits?

  ***

- 🟨 improvement: CSS - h2,3 bigger. biege color, new imgs, with dark bg. even h1, subtitle beige

Notes:

- each book/pdf upload should include a short desc. so that i can query/display only that short-desc from the codices TABLE, not the pdf_files TABLE. the pdf_data row of that table needs to convert from binary->substring... so it's much harder

- Related Note: the ids for pdf_files, codices tables need to line up/be the same every upload/db entry. this will make the code queries be in synch. -- in other words; `codices` table data, needs to line up with `pdf_files` table data. (so upon registration page upload form)
