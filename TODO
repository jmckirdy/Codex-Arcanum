### <span style="color:#ff0000;background-color:black">Most High Priority</span>

- 🟩 Fix Nav links by SELECT \* from books,codices,spells.
- 🟩 fix: style h3 emojis with normal not italiacs

<br>

- 🟩 bug: when enchanment is cast just go straight to showing the page with the new enchantment, NOT the current way. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Instead;</b> link to curr. page via url in key="enchant.inc.php?key=value& ..."

Notes:

- each book/pdf upload should include a short desc. so that i can query/display only that short-desc from the codices TABLE, not the pdf_files TABLE. the pdf_data row of that table needs to convert from binary->substring... so it's much harder
