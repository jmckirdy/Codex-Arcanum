Because the topic of programming is so vast, the Mad Wizard is determined to focus (mostly) upon programming for the web. Here's a array of what that may include [PHP, JavaScript, Python, C++, C, Linux, Bash, DSA, Web Design, Redirects, Hosting, Infastructure, DevOps, ...].

Wizard/Mage/Sorcerer: Synonymous with programmer.

Codex(Codices): A Mage's final draft of notes (doc/pdf) uploaded to the site. Should be 2-15 pages long. If mage has more notes on a given topic they shall be split up into Part I, Part II, etc.

Books: Same as in English, with the caveat that the book should pertain to programming, and perhaps fantasy or medieval history. Should be 80-800 pages long.

Spell: A stored script written by the wizard or another programmer.

Enchantment: A key-takeaway cast by the wizard upon reviewing a codex or book.

Cast: Synonymous commenting or posting an enchantment.

Category: Codices fall under one category or topic.

Tags: Tags fall under one codice or book. Aim to include 3-12 tags with every upload.
